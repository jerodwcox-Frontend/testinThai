<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>I’m officially a web developer.</p>
<h2>👋 Hey there, Internet Traveler!</h2>

<p>Welcome to my very first webpage — where the code might still be a little messy, but the excitement is <b><u>100%</b></u> real! 🚀</p>

<p>I’m just getting started on my web programming journey, learning how to make pixels dance and buttons actually do something. 😄 </p>

<p>Expect experiments, typos, small victories, and probably a few “why isn’t this working!?” moments.</p>
<p>But hey — that’s how every great coder starts, right?</p>

<p>So grab a coffee ☕, click around (gently, please), and watch this space grow as I learn to turn ideas into code.</p>

<p>Let’s <strong>build</strong> something awesome — one <div> at a time!</p>
